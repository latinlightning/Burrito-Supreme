    - Tried to connect the client to the server on Port 99 and were unable to successfully send a message to the intended recipient. We       are looking into port forwarding and what port might be safe. Port 99 looks like it is being used to mine Dash and has some             potential trojans. We were able to send messages on a local computer though. The next goal will be to set up an enviornment             whether it be a different port or creating a .jar file to have this run standalone. Maybe it was Eclipse being funky because it         was kind of hard to get it to even have the programs run at all. After we do that, we will then try and adjust the while loop so        that each party can send/receive messages and not have to wait for a response from the other party.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - Maybe create a repalcement for Discord in the end.
