# Burrito-Supreme
Provide the greatest single-hand burritos known to man

Goals (First)
  - End to End Text Messaging Application
    - 2 Users
    - Server Establishment for each user
    - Ability to talk on other users server
  - Encrypted messages
  - Windows Compatible
  - Simple GUI
 
Ideal Sequence of Events
1. User opens application
2. Their server is established
3. Another User can connect their server and send a message to the other user
4. Connected servers will retain a copy of the communication so that each user can retrieve a chain of messages
5. User closes application

    - Tried to connect the client to the server on Port 99 and were unable to successfully send a message to the intended recipient. We       are looking into port forwarding and what port might be safe. Port 99 looks like it is being used to mine Dash and has some             potential trojans. We were able to send messages on a local computer though. The next goal will be to set up an enviornment             whether it be a different port or creating a .jar file to have this run standalone. Maybe it was Eclipse being funky because it         was kind of hard to get it to even have the programs run at all. After we do that, we will then try and adjust the while loop so        that each party can send/receive messages and not have to wait for a response from the other party.

   - No coding today at all. It was a research today and we were trying to learn how IRC servers connect servers/clients and looking          to see if we could do it purely in Java. We thought we found something with a post where someone shared their soruce code but it        was no longer available. After that we learned about port forwarding and the different types and seeing how we could implement it        into the code we already have. There was one way we might have been able to connect though, which was for me to make changes to the      Admin settings on my router which would have allowed ports to be open which would have allowed us to make a server. But doing this      pretty much defeats the purpose of makng a Simple Java program. Might have to reevaluate if we want this to be a pure java              application. Another language in conjunction might be necearry to provide a simple experience for the user.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - Maybe create a repalcement for Discord in the end.
